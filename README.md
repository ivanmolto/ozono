# OZONO

A Web3 social discovery app powered by KNN3.

Unleash your Web3 social marketing power - a tool to make it easy -

This application was created for ETH Shanghai Hackathon some months ago. It was one of the winners of the challenges sponsored by [KNN3](https://www.knn3.xyz).
But it was time for an upgrade and the goal for this bounty was to use the RSS3 API in this existing project.

Please feel free to contact me at my email: ivanmolto@gmail.com or via Discord at ivanmolto#3768

The application is live at [ozono.app](https://www.ozono.app)

Thank you!

## SETUP

This application uses the [RSS3 API](https://docs.rss3.io/reference) from [RSS3](https://rss3.io). And to be more specific it gets donation and governance [notes from an instance](https://docs.rss3.io/reference/getnotesbyinstance) to display donations and governance feeds.

This application also uses the [GraphQL endpoint](https://mw.graphql.knn3.xyz) from KNN3.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Other clients and libraries used are [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/v4), [urql](https://formidable.com/open-source/urql/), [React Router v6](https://reactrouter.com/docs/en/v6/getting-started/overview) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com).

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
